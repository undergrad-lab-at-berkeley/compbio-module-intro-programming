    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the introductory Python module!  This module will guide you through the process of using Python. Don't worry if you don't have any programming experience; we'll start from the basics and don't assume any prior knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **general-purpose programming language**. This means that it is suited for a wide variety of tasks (as opposed to domain-specific programming languages like R, which is used primarily for statistical computing). Python is generally considered an easy-to-use and flexible programming language, and because of this it's used in nearly every field imaginable (including as a teaching language in most introductory CS and Data Science courses, and very frequently in Computational Biology). One of the biggest strengths of Python is its large community and the wealth of **libraries** available for it, which are collections of code written by other people that you can use in your own projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Interacting with Python through Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "The main way we will be interacting with Python is through an environment called **Jupyter**. As mentioned in the first module, this is the environment we are currently working in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Jupyter?\n",
    "*From the Jupyter documentation:* \"First and foremost, the Jupyter Notebook is **an interactive environment for writing and running code**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter provides an interactive environment called a *notebook*, which enables you to run code and directly observe its output. It also allows you to mix text, LaTeX, images, and more with your code. This document was written using a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also commonly run on the command line (on Mac or Linux, you can test this out, since some form of python is usually pre-installed: open the terminal on your operating system and type `python` to launch the Python interactive mode. Note that on Macs, you may have the older Python 2 version installed, which is now no longer supported). We prefer to use Jupyter Notebook (at least for now!) because of its friendlier interface and the ability to have plain text, LaTeX, images, and even videos on the same screen as your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, unlike a Python script, which is a continuous \"block\" of code, Jupyter Notebooks are split up into **cells** of code that can be run independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks run in a web browser; however, you do **not** need to be connected to the internet to access or edit them. For the purposes of this module we will be working online through the Berkeley Datahub (visit [datahub.berkeley.edu](https://datahub.berkeley.edu) to create your own notebooks), but if necessary you can install Jupyter on your personal computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Cells?\n",
    "Cells are the modular pieces that make up a Jupyter Notebook. Cells primarily come in two types (although there are more): **Code** and **Markdown**. The cell that you are currently looking at is a Markdown cell: it displays plain text. A code cell, as the name suggests, contains code that can be executed. Here is an example of a cell:"

    "By default, a new cell is created as a code cell, but you can change a cell from one to the other in the dropdown at the top of this panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to interact with cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command Mode:** Press `Esc`, notice the cell outline will turn blue.  <br>\n",
    "**Edit Mode:** Press `Enter`, or double-click on a cell. Notice it will now have a green outline. As the name suggests, this is the mode to be in if you want to edit the contents of individual cells.<br>\n",
    "<br>**Common Shortcuts**<br>\n",
    "* `Ctrl-Enter`: Run current cell. Do this for all example cells presented in this module so you can observe the output (try it out with the example above; you may have to use `Cmd-Enter` on a Mac).\n",
    "* `Shift-Enter`: Run current cell, and select cell below\n",
    "* `H`: Show all keyboard shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of great guides in the Help menu at the top of the window as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the kernel?\n",
    "Another term that pops up often is the kernel. The IPython kernel is the \"computational engine\" that executes the code contained in a Notebook document. You can think of it as the active process that is processing all of the Notebook's activity and executing its Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, each section of this module will feature one or more short exercises, which are designed to get you familiar with using the content presented on your own. Note that you may have to look through the built-in help or at online documentation in order to complete some exercises; this is a useful skill when dealing with unfamiliar code such as that in some of your projects. You should complete the exercises as instructed within this document, and turn in the entire ipynb document for credit for the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit the contents of this cell by adding some lines below this section, and hit `Ctrl-Enter` to display its contents in a nicely-formatted way. Notice the formatting in the text here, such as how I've used **two asterisks** to bold text, *one asterisk* to italicize it, `backticks` to denote code, and hashtags for headers. To get a more thorough understanding of the different formatting options available, look into \"Markdown Syntax\".\n",
    "2. The next cell will be stuck in an infinite loop once it is run. Much of the time, infinite loops are problematic, since they will just continuously run without any direct way to stop them. An external influence is needed to \"pull the plug\". In Jupyter's case, you can interrupt the kernel by pressing the `Stop` (black square) button at the top of the editor panel.<br><br>"

Chances are you've probably run into variables in a math class, representing a quantity that changes, e.g. $x$ is the variable in the polynomial $f(x) = x^2$. In programming languages, a variable is a reserved spot in computer memory that stores a particular value or a reference to an object. Each variable has a *type*, which is the kind of data that is being stored (for example, `integer` or `int` variables are whole numbers, `string` variables store text, etc.); this idea is discussed more in the next section. All languages have variables but variables in Python are *dynamically-typed* (unlike other statically-typed languages like Java). This means that you can define a variable `x` to be certain type (e.g. integer) and then later in your code assign `x` to a different type (e.g string).\n",

    "\n",
    "Something else you may notice here is the comment, which reads `# The following assigns a the value of 5`. The # character is used to mark comments, and it indicates to Python that everything from that character to the end of the line should not be read as code. This is very useful to document the different parts of your own code, which is then helpful when you are trying to track down errors. Well-commented code is also incredibly useful when collaborating with others, as it may not always be easy to understand each others' code. Commenting is also useful for commenting-out sections of code you don't want to run temporarily (i.e. without deleting the code), which is useful in debugging and when you may be editing your code but don't want to lose what you previously had.\n",

The second set of parentheses tests whether 12 is not equal to 2. Both of these expressions are `True`. In between them we have `and`, which gives a value of `True` only if *both* expressions on either side of it are `True`. Since this is the case, the `and` expression is true. Next, we have the `or (5<3)` portion. The part in the parentheses we know to be false. However, `or` will return true if *at least one* of the expressions on each side of it is `True`. Since the part on the left is true, the entire expression is thus `True`. Note that this useage of `or` is a bit different from how we  use the word \"or\" in English. Normally, when we say \"or\", we exclude the possibility that *both* statements are True; however in Python this is not the case.

    "2. \"Language Reference\": This describes in detail all of the built-in language features. It is not something you will reference much at all, but if you want a description of how various parts of the language function under the hood, this is a good place to start.\n",
    "3. \"Library Reference\": This describes the Python **standard library**, which includes all of the built-in functions and data types, as well as various pre-included libraries which are useful for various tasks. This is something you will reference very often. \n",
    "\n",
    "Between the Tutorial, Library Reference, and the documentation for any library you are using, you should be able to solve many of the problems you encounter while coding. You are encouraged to look around through these different sources of information, to familiarize yourself with their layout and the information they provide. \n",

    "Oftentimes you will be faced with situations where you cannot properly use the internal documentation to solve a problem. For example, you may know the task you need to do but not the names of functions/methods that can accomplish it, or you may be encountering an unfamiliar error message. In this case, the best resource to turn to is the internet. Oftentimes you can simply Google what you are trying to do (make sure to keep your searches simple and have \"Python\" or \"Numpy\" in the search to find Python/Numpy-specific results) and find many resources helping you. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you can often simply copy-paste error messages into Google (or perhaps with adding a few words describing what you were trying to do) to find resources discussing causes and solutions. One particularly useful resource is StackOverflow. This is a set of forums for many different topics, which has many subforums related to programming questions. Users post questions they have on the forum, and others can pitch in with possible solutions. If you encounter an error in your code, chances are a similar error has been asked as a question there before, and it will often be among the top Google search results for your error message.\n",

    "The manual method of doing this would of course be to physically add spaces between each of the words. However, we're asked in this problem to look up the `join` method for strings. We know from earlier that we are likely to find this in the *library reference*, since this is where information on built-in types (like strings) is located. Indeed, when we look for the `join` method in the **String Methods** section of the approporiate part of the documentation, we find the following description (you can see it online [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join)):\n",

    "    \n",
    "There is a fair bit of information we don't need here, but the first and last sentence of the description are crucial. Recall that we are trying to combine (or *concatenate*) multiple strings, with the output including spaces between strings. Here, we can see that `join` concatenates strings presented in the argument *iterable*, which from its name we can deduce is an iterable object like a list. However, we need to know what actual string to use the method on. This is where the last sentence becomes important: \"The separator between elements is the string providing this method.\" In other words, to make a space separate the elements of the list, we just use the method on a space. This can be done as follows:"
